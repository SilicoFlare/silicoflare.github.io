			<i>
				<p>
					I still remember the day we met,<br>
					Twenty-three seas had our destiny set,<br>
					I blushed like a girl on seeing you,<br>
					That was when I started liking you.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You were always in my thoughts,<br>
					Qualities of a friend you had lots,<br>
					I then decided, no matter whatever,<br>
					I would make you my best friend forever.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					After college, we had the best walks,<br>
					Complete with the most wonderful talks,<br>
					The food stalls were our pass time,<br>
					We were always partners in crime.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					We teased each other on studying well,<br>
					We laughed at jokes till we fell,<br>
					We argued on the answers after every test,<br>
					Without talking to you I couldn't rest.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Slim and cute, never mute,<br>
					You like to observe stuff minute,<br>
					You're also good at technology,<br>
					To praise you, I have no analogy.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I still think back to the day we met,<br>
					As we stood in the college fence,<br>
					Though I was in the rain, completely wet,<br>
					I felt warm just by your presence.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I kept you in an esteem very high,<br>
					I thought of you as the sun in my sky,<br>
					I would never bring a tear in your eye,<br>
					And stay by your side till I die.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					But Fate had plans for me in store,<br>
					Which shook our friendship from the core,<br>
					Though for you, I did big and small,<br>
					You never seemed to notice it at all.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					For you I was one of those friends,<br>
					Who existed only till the college ends,<br>
					Though I treated you as my bestie,<br>
					I was for you just another entity.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Thinking it would never affect you,<br>
					I started finding more friends new,<br>
					And then I found the coolest pals,<br>
					Two cool guys and three crazy gals.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					They were of mine a constant company,<br>
					I made them close with my jokes funny,<br>
					I started prioritizing them over you,<br>
					And with you I spent only minutes few.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					God knows how, but you WERE affected,<br>
					That thought in your eyes was reflected,<br>
					Thinking I left you for good,<br>
					You started ignoring me, which was rude.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I started observing it too late,<br>
					Destined to happen on the stage of Fate,<br>
					Though I tried to speak to you,<br>
					I could just meet your behaviour new.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Disturbance became a part of me,<br>
					When I saw you during hours free,<br>
					The agony of losing you hit me like a dagger,<br>
					From the path of happiness I began to stagger.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I always had tears when I thought of you,<br>
					I always felt anxious when the break bell rang,<br>
					Not only did I lose you,<br>
					I lost the members of our gang.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					For my part of mistake I had to be sorry,<br>
					As the guilt I could no more carry.<br>
					I always tried to gather courage,<br>
					From my book of life I wanted to tear that page.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					When I apologized, you gave acknowledgement,<br>
					But afterwards you kept me at arm's length,<br>
					When I wanted to speak to you a word,<br>
					You always made the situation awkward.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You always tried to avoid me,<br>
					Your ego was in the path like a tree,<br>
					I couldn't tolerate this attitude of yours,<br>
					And so I decided to end this by force.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I then told you that it's all over,<br>
					You wouldn't apologize, no matter whatever,<br>
					But both of us decided to change our mind,<br>
					A way to get back we had to find.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I know you never realized your mistake,<br>
					The drops of my explanation could fill up a lake,<br>
					How come you blamed it all on me,<br>
					When your own faults you can't see?<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You were the one to ignore me first,<br>
					When I did the same, you treated me worst.<br>
					Both did it and we settled the score,<br>
					Why still keep your ego in your core?<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					You were the one who broke me first,<br>
					Yet you make ME go through the worst,<br>
					If you couldn't my feelings return,<br>
					Why didn't you, on the first day, take an about turn?<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					To you I am an outcast everywhere,<br>
					To never consider me you are always aware.<br>
					You treat me like I committed a sin,<br>
					What about your own mistakes you hid in?<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I killed my self-respect to get you back,<br>
					But the qualities of compassion you lack,<br>
					If you think in your life I am useless,<br>
					Why live at the cost of my happiness?<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					But I don’t wanna let go off you,<br>
					Because we can still start a friendship new.<br>
					Forgetting all the bad that happened between us,<br>
					We can continue to have our talks in the bus.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I yearn for that special day to come,<br>
					When with friendship, we become one.<br>
					For that, my friend, whatever you say,<br>
					I will wait for you till my last day...<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I write these lines, tears making them wet,<br>
					As I remember the day we met...<br>
