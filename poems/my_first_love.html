			<i>
				<p>
					It was the first day of school,<br>
					I was happy to meet my friends cool,<br>
					I knew that I would rock this year,<br>
					And make proud all my near and dear.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					As I was speaking to my pals,<br>
					I gave a glance at the gals.<br>
					And I thought my heart skipped a beat,<br>
					Coz I saw there a new girl sweet.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Never did I see a girl so cute,<br>
					I kept staring at her, mute.<br>
					I didn't care about what's around,<br>
					Coz my first love I had found.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I fell hard for that girl with glasses,<br>
					She was in my thoughts during all classes.<br>
					But to talk to her I was very shy,<br>
					The lack of courage made me cry.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally I gathered up my dare,<br>
					What others think I didn't care.<br>
					I held out my hand and closed my eyes,<br>
					And stood still like frozen ice.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					She smiled as she greeted me,<br>
					The inner me danced with glee.<br>
					I really shouted in my mind,<br>
					"How can someone be so kind?"<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I praised her with words big and small,<br>
					That she was the person with qualities all,<br>
					She blushed as she looked into my eyes,<br>
					It was enough to melt me like ice.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					In no time we became best pals,<br>
					Which made jealous the other gals,<br>
					Not talking to her means the day was wasted,<br>
					If I had to leave her, I would die instead.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					She too seemed interested,<br>
					I learned this from my friends trusted.<br>
					She liked me a lot, and I was no less,<br>
					So I knew it was time to confess.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I couldn't sleep on the night before her birthday,<br>
					I needed to write down what I had to say.<br>
					I also made a cute ring of paper,<br>
					Which I would give when I confessed to her.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The day of confession came at last,<br>
					I got ready and went to school fast.<br>
					There I saw her, the princess of my heart,<br>
					I stood in awe as I admired Nature's art.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I wished her a happy birthday with a cheer,<br>
					As everyone left, I made myself clear,<br>
					I held her hand and sat on my knee,<br>
					I looked into her eyes and asked, "Will you date me?"<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					She blushed as she nodded a happy yes,<br>
					I was happy that my quest was a success.<br>
					We sat that whole day together,<br>
					It was a memory to cherish forever.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I gave her all the teenage love I had,<br>
					She never gave me a chance to be sad.<br>
					We spent the bus travels in each other's arm,<br>
					It was our love in us that kept us warm.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					We used to glance at each other,<br>
					I used to touch her hand walking past her.<br>
					We knew that nothing could end,<br>
					The string of love between us without a bend.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally came Christmas, the day of giving,<br>
					We knew that this was the right timing.<br>
					Our empty classroom was our mistletoe,<br>
					As we swore to support, in joy or woe.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					She did give me atlast, a kiss,<br>
					Nothing could break our love bliss.<br>
					But Fate had plans for us in store,<br>
					And as we suffered, She kept giving more.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Suddenly to leave school, I was told,<br>
					Thinking about her, tears rolled.<br>
					I didn't know how to tell it to her,<br>
					I always thought of it when with her.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					When I told at last, she bitterly cried,<br>
					She begged me to tell that I lied.<br>
					But it was the truth, I couldn't change it,<br>
					The fire of love was put off soon after it was lit.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The day finally came, to go away far,<br>
					I tearfully looked at her from my car.<br>
					She ran to me and gave me a chocolate,<br>
					But to give her a gift, it was too late.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I couldn't contact her through text or call,<br>
					I knew I had to give up my hopes all.<br>
					Never did I know that I would see,<br>
					A story of my life that took away my glee.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I cried for days with her thoughts,<br>
					I couldn't even say her I miss her lots.<br>
					In agony, I made many a regrettable error,<br>
					Whose consequences till now I suffer.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					I still wish I could get back to her,<br>
					I really don't want anyone other.<br>
					But I should suffer, I made the sin,<br>
					I had to give up, and let Fate win.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					After three years we met again,<br>
					Mature enough with all the pain.<br>
					But I couldn't that moment frame,<br>
					Coz things between us weren't the same...<br>
