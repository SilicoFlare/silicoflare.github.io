    Heyyyyy Harineee!!
    <p>Finally 3 semesters of friendship between us! I don't know how fast time passed, and we became so good friends! Yes, I know something bad existed between us, but yes, we won over it! Now it's more like my day isn't complete without speaking to you!</p>
    <p>Well so you would wonder why am I speaking like this out of the blue. Now you need to read seriously. It's an important thing: I still like you.. Yes, I am serious af. Not a dare, not a prank or not anything else. It is a pure confession. I have always liked you since I left school. Wait wait, lemme explain myself. I know it's the most shameless thing I could do, but hear me out first. I realised my mistake long back, but I just didn't know the exact way I had to tell you. I know I have made you go through the worst, and so have I. I never went into a relationship after you. I never felt to date anyone except you. I couldn't think of any other girl. All I did was think of you and blush like a girl who's head over heels in love. I ain't lying, I have betrayed you enough, and I don't wanna do it again.</p>
    <p>Now you may ask, there are so many other boys in PES, why choose me. Coz I know you so much! And yeah, trust me plz, I have actually changed a lot. You would have seen glimpses of it, though I didn't reveal it completely. I understood that love can be expressed without telling "I love you" even once. I can show such love. And yeah, not to forget, I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't do drugs, and my first kiss... well, you have taken it already. I already decided that I'll talk to my parents when it's time to marry, and I'll surely make you my bride. I want you to be my companion in this wonderful journey called life. We'll travel to places together, we'll have all kinds of adventures, and yeah.. nah never mind, we'll think of it after marriage. I will take real good care of you, and yeah, this time "Never gonna give you up!" Rickrolled! </p>
    <p>Okay, jokes apart, I'm real serious abt this da. I know I broke your trust once upon a time, and it did take time for you to regain it back. I promise, if we get back, I'll never leave you or cheat on you again, no matter how far we are from each other. I won't leave you till you tell me to leave, with a valid reason. And yeah, I rarely make promises, and when I do, I never break them. I should have promised to never leave you back then... And yeah, god forbid if I break it, which is impossible, may I not marry anyone in my life. On my word. Whatever, the past is past, and here we are, at what could be the beginning of a beautiful journey ahead...</p>
    <p>Just think over it. If you agree, I'll surely keep you happy. Worst case scenario, if you don't want to.. still okay, coz if you are happy, then I'm happy too! Atleast I'll have you on my side as a friend, which I thought I'll never have. Just think over it, please. I'll never leave you, I promise..</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Today's edit: Though I saw hatred in your eyes today, I actually blushed when I realized that I finally got to meet you. The reason I missed meeting you on day 1 was a rather silly reason: I was too shy to look fo you and look into your eyes... And yeah, I feel I was too optimistic about our relationship, so excuse me for that..</p>
