        Aadi strode in the rain, lost deep in his thoughts. Like a scorpio would, he loved to walk in the rain, as he claims, "No one would see my tears." But at this moment, he was not sad. Or you could say so. His birthday was tomorrow. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A part of a happy family, Aadi has always been a good son to his parents, and a good brother to his sister. A completely busy family, so they enjoy to the best when they get time to spend together. His mom, a teacher, is known for her punctuality, and his dad, a software employee, for his values. Aadi has truly inherited these values, along with some "Aadi-only" characteristics. A well-known member in his extended family too, he is looked upon as the achiever, and is target to large amounts of pressure from them, especially his aunt and uncle. Not a problem, though, coz he has seen worse. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        He is more or less the president of his apartment commitee, thanks to everyone flocking to him when there is an event to organize. He is the organizer, the host, the planner and what not. In short, for any given programme hosted in Aratt Firenza, you could say this: "STORY - SCREENPLAY - DIRECTION: Aadi". An exaggeration, but yeah it's close to it.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Now the worst part of everything: friends. You may think how, but yes, he has been through the worst coz of them. Due to being a newcomer in grade 3 to a completely new school in a completely new state, he had trouble making friends. He was a bright student, and as expected, he was isolated by everyone. The speech problem he developed during grade 6 made it worse.
    </p>
    <p>
        But he coped up with this too, like he did with everything else. He never let loneliness take over him. His suffering was neutralized in the last 2 years of school when he made new friends and memories galore.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast forwarding the 2 years of his college life, we find these stuff: another round of new friends, prep for JEE, get togethers with Bus Stop Buddies, helping Flare get out of deep shit, bonding with juniors, Low Expectations skit, lot of hardwork and a flustered mode on Annual Day, graduation from Parihar University (IYKYK) and random other stuff...
    </p>
    <p>
        11:59 PM. Though he wasn't waiting for his birthday, he still wondered who will be the first person to message him. Will it be Flare? Will it be the sweet junior Devi? Will it be his lost love Pratha? Or will it be the poet in him? It has always been his habit of staying awake till late night, and sometimes overnight, too. Claims that 3 AM thoughts are for people who sleep, so don't apply to him. One night at 4 AM he went to the kitchen to get water and sleep, and his mom, who was awake at that time too, thought he woke up early and praised him, until she saw him floating towards the bed like a spirit. That night, 3 things fell down. Aadi on his bed. His mom's hopes on him. A stick on his ass.
    </p>

        Finally the clock struck twelve, and synchronously a message popped on his screen. From an unknown number. Interesting start of a new year, he thought. He opened it up and started reading:
    </p>
    <div class="before12">
        (Well well well... it ain't 12 yet, so click the following button at 12 AM.)<br>
        <button onclick="window.location.reload(true)">Refresh</button>
    </div>
    <div class="after12">
        <p class="format">
            "Hey Aadi! First of all, a very happy birthday to you!! Enjoy your day, have a beautiful year ahead, and stay safe. Finally you have crossed one of the most monumental checkpoints of your life: the age of 18. They say it is the age of maturity, but I know, and God knows too, that you seen enough and were mature enough even before this. Thanks a lot for everything you have done for me and are doing for me. Always be the person you always have been, and never forget that I will always be on your side, to congratulate you when you win, to support you when you fail, and to encourage you to fight when you are in problems. When the whole world was letting me down, you showed me my future with your presence in my life. Yes, 4 years of friendship we have, and I can proudly say that we never had even 1 instance of difference in these years. Your support was invaluable in times when I needed it. You were the one who infused the concept of nationalism in me, which I live by till date. You showed me how to fight problems face to face. You showed me the way life has to be lived. You showed me what it means to be a true friend.
        </p>
        <p class="format">    
            Speaking of the age of 18, it is when you realise that quality matters a lot than quantity, that giving a shit about what everyone say is not always the right thing, that betrayals might happen by the most unexpected people, and that it takes more than guts to be a man.
        </p>
        <p class="format">
            All the very best for an amazing future that lies ahead in University. Make new friends and memories, cherish the old ones, learn new things, work hard, achieve your dreams and show the damn world what you are capable of. Never let someone affect you. It's your life, you choose how to live it. Yes, you will face betrayals and oppression from the people least expected, but always be ready for what I call the worst case scenario. 
        </p>
        <p class="format">
            May god bless you with a life worth of happiness, success and wealth. May you live a long and happy life."
        </p>
        <p>
            That night, he realised he gained two things. A companion who wouldn't let him down. A dark world ahead to explore...
